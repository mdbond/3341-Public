### 3341-Public/quandary

`quandary.pdf` describes the Quandary language and runtime specification.

The `ref` folder contains a pre-built, obfuscated Quandary reference interpreter. Execute `ref/quandary` to run the interpreter.

The `skeleton` folder contains source code for a very simple interpreter. See `skeleton/README` for build and run info.

The `examples` folder contains Quandary code examples.

The `grading` folder contains the grading template.

#### GETTING STARTED

See `TROUBLESHOOTING` if you have trouble getting the Quandary reference interpreter or skeleton running.

Read `quandary.pdf` before attempting the projects.
